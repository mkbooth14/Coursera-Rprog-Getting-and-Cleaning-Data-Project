# Coursera-Rprog-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course Data Science Specialization. The R script, run_analysis.R, performs the following tasks:

1. Enables the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from the University of California, Irvine to be downloaded if it has not already been done.
2. Loads and merges the activity, feature info, and measurements from both the training and test data sets.
3. Filters the training and test data sets so only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation are kept.
4. Merges the training and the test sets to create one (tidy) data set.
5. Provides descriptive and tidy labels for the activities and variables.
6. Creates another (tidy) data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

See CodeBook.md for a description of the variables, the data, and the transformations performed to clean up the data. Additionally, a full description of the data is avaliable at the site where it was obtained:
